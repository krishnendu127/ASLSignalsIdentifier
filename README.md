The Hand Gesture Recognition project aims to detect and recognize hand gestures in real-time using Python. It utilizes computer vision techniques to capture video from a webcam, process the images to identify hands, and then classify the gestures made by the hands.
The project employs the cvzone library, which provides functionality for hand tracking and gesture recognition. It leverages a pre-trained Keras model to classify the detected hand gestures. The gestures can be anything from simple finger poses to more complex hand movements.
The main objective of the project is to showcase how computer vision and machine learning techniques can be used to create interactive applications. Hand gesture recognition has various applications, including sign language interpretation, gesture-based user interfaces, and virtual reality interactions.
By running the provided script, users can interact with the system by making different hand gestures in front of their webcam. The program will then detect and classify these gestures, providing an engaging and interactive experience.
Overall, the Hand Gesture Recognition project demonstrates the capabilities of computer vision and machine learning in recognizing and interpreting human gestures, opening up possibilities for innovative applications in various fields.
